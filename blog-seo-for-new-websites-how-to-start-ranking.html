    <h1>SEO for new websites: how to start ranking</h1>

    <h2>So your website’s live. Now what?</h2>
    <p>You’ve launched your website. The homepage looks polished, the design feels solid, and maybe you’ve even posted a blog or two.</p>
    <p>And now… nothing.</p>
    <p>No traffic.</p>
    <p>No clicks.</p>
    <p>No clear next step.</p>
    <p>This is the part that often gets missed: your website doesn’t automatically earn attention. You need to give Google a reason to notice it.</p>
    <p>That doesn’t mean fixing everything at once. But you do need a starting point and a few essential elements in place to build visibility.</p>
    <p>Here’s where we start when helping new sites begin to rank in search.</p>

    <h3>1. Spell it out for your audience (and Google)</h3>
    <p>Search engines, and real people, need specifics. If your homepage opens with something vague like “Helping you thrive with better solutions,” it’s unclear what you offer or who it’s for.</p>
    <p>Before you worry about keywords, focus on the message at the top of your homepage.</p>
    <p>Say what you do in plain terms, like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>“Website content and strategy for science‑led teams and technical founders.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That one sentence gives people and search engines something to work with straight away.</p>

    <h3>2. Choose keywords that match how people actually search</h3>
    <p>Skip broad phrases like “digital marketing.” They’re too competitive and not specific enough. Avoid vague language like “scale your brand with purpose” — it doesn’t align with what real users are typing into search bars.</p>
    <p>Instead, look for practical, focused keywords that reflect your audience’s intent. You want to position your business as the solution for their problem.</p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SEO for consultants UK</li>
        <li>Website content for biotech startups</li>
        <li>AI tools for marketing teams</li>
        <li>Affordable website redesign for science companies</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Use tools like Ubersuggest, AnswerThePublic, or simply try Google autocomplete to see how people phrase their questions.</p>

    <h3>3. Prioritise your core pages</h3>
    <p>You don’t need to launch with a massive site. Start with a few pages that do their job well.</p>
    <p>Here's what you might choose to focus on first:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Homepage – Use a clear headline, brief introduction, and set a meta title and description that reflect what you offer</li>
        <li>About page – Include your name, what you specialise in, and keywords that matter to your sector</li>
        <li>One service page or blog – Keep it focused on a specific topic that people are likely to search for</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These three pages alone can lay a solid foundation and start building traction.</p>

    <h3>4. Write blog posts that answer real questions</h3>
    <p>If you’ve worked with clients, you’ve already got content ideas. The questions people ask you every week are exactly the topics worth turning into blog posts.</p>
    <p>Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What should I include on my homepage?</li>
        <li>Do I need a blog for my consultancy?</li>
        <li>How can I use ChatGPT for content that sounds like me?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Blog posts work best when they answer real questions and offer something useful. Even one well‑written article each month can start building relevance and trust.</p>

    <h3>5. Let Google find your site</h3>
    <p>If you haven’t already, set up Google Search Console. It’s a free tool that helps you monitor how your site appears in search results — and gives you direct insight into what’s working.</p>
    <p>Once you're set up, submit your sitemap. This is a simple file (usually created automatically by your SEO plugin if you're using WordPress) that lists all the key pages on your site. It helps Google understand your site’s structure and find your content more efficiently.</p>
    <p>Submitting your sitemap tells Google where to look, but Search Console also gives you access to useful performance data, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Which pages are being indexed</li>
        <li>How often your site appears in search results</li>
        <li>What search terms people use to find you</li>
        <li>How many clicks those pages receive</li>
        <li>Any issues preventing pages from being crawled or indexed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This helps you see where your site is already gaining traction — and where there’s still room to improve.</p>

    <h3>6. Stay visible, even if growth feels slow</h3>
    <p>New sites often take 3 to 6 months to appear in search results. That’s expected. What matters is that you keep the site active in the meantime.</p>
    <p>Update a page. Add a blog post. Make small improvements. These signs of activity show both users and search engines that your site is worth paying attention to.</p>

    <h2>In short, here’s where to start:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Refine your homepage messaging so it’s specific and easy to understand</li>
        <li>Publish one or two blog posts that answer common questions in your space</li>
        <li>Add clear meta titles and descriptions to your main pages</li>
        <li>Submit your sitemap through Google Search Console</li>
        <li>Keep the site active with regular updates, even if they’re small</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When you have established your site, a full content strategy can come later. What matters first is having a simple, clear structure that helps people find your site and stay engaged when they do.</p>
