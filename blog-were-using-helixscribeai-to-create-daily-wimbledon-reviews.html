    <h1>We're using HelixScribe.AI to create daily Wimbledon reviews</h1>

    <p>Daily Wimbledon match recaps, powered by AI. See how HelixScribe creates smart, readable content inside The Love of Tennis app.</p>

    <p>This Wimbledon, we’re testing something different from the usual tennis stats.</p>

    <p>Starting 30th June, we’ll publish one match recap a day using HelixScribe — the tool we built to make content creation smarter, faster, and more personal.</p>

    <p>No prompt tweaking. No back‑and‑forth edits. No confusing AI outputs to decipher.</p>

    <p>We’ll be capturing all the action from SW19 — match stats, standout moments, and key storylines — then organising that information so it’s easy to work with. From there, we refine it into clear, readable copy and apply it to a niche audience: tennis fans who want smart, accessible summaries.</p>

    <p>Each post is then reviewed and improved based on tone, structure, and relevance, helping the content evolve over time to better reflect what people actually want to read. All of this will happen automatically and populate the tennis app we produced – 'The Love of Tennis'.</p>

    <p>That full workflow follows the CREATE method we use in HelixScribe:</p>
    <p>Capture → Refine → Educate → Apply → Track → Evolve.</p>
    <p>(Yes, it spells CREATE.)</p>

    <p>We’re exploring how automated content might make high‑quality writing more accessible — and whether it can help open up a sport that often feels closed off.</p>

    <p>At the same time, we’re testing whether AI can support more people to say something worth reading, in a natural, human tone that reflects their voice, not a machine’s.</p>
