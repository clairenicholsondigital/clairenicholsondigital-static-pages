    <h1>Why your website isn't ranking (despite doing all the right things)</h1>

    <p>You’ve installed Yoast, your WordPress SEO plugins.</p>
    <p>You’ve added meta descriptions.</p>
    <p>You’ve published a few blog posts (or had ChatGPT draft them for you).</p>
    <p>You’ve even Googled your own site a few times just to check.</p>

    <p>And yet… nothing. No clicks. No visibility.</p>
    <p>Maybe a few impressions, but no one’s actually visiting.</p>

    <p>You’re doing what SEO advice tells you to do — so why isn’t it working?</p>

    <h2>SEO isn’t broken — your content setup might be</h2>
    <p>Most SEO advice online is either vague (“just create quality content!”) or hyper‑specific in a way that’s unhelpful (“your H2 should have a long‑tail keyword about your niche service sector”).</p>
    <p>And for expert‑led teams — consultants, creatives, scientists, founders — that advice usually misses the point. You’re not trying to spam keywords. You’re trying to be found for what you actually do.</p>
    <p>Here’s where things typically go wrong:</p>

    <h3>1. You’re ranking for the wrong things</h3>
    <p>You might be showing up in search, but for low‑intent keywords that don’t convert. For example: a blog titled “Why We Love Research” won’t help if people are searching “best CRO for biotech partnerships”.</p>

    <h3>2. You’ve got titles and metadata that don’t invite clicks</h3>
    <p>If your meta descriptions are just a vague summary of the blog, or your page titles are too clever for their own good, people won’t click — even if you do rank. (One of my own pages got over 6,000 impressions and 0 clicks. Zero.)</p>

    <h3>3. You’re writing in isolation — not building a system</h3>
    <p>You write one blog post. Then another. And another. But they don’t link to each other. They don’t support your services page. They don’t rank collectively. They’re just… floating.</p>

    <h3>4. Your website and content don’t speak the same language</h3>
    <p>Your homepage says one thing. Your blog says another. Your About page is outdated. Google can’t tell what you’re trying to rank for — and neither can your audience.</p>

    <h2>So what actually creates website traffic?</h2>
    <p>Not more content. Not more tools.</p>
    <p>What works is a system that supports your content from the start — one that’s:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Built on real search terms your audience actually uses</li>
        <li>Structured so your website, blog, and services pages reinforce each other</li>
        <li>Designed to scale — so you can repurpose and reuse content without rewriting everything</li>
        <li>Clear, so people want to click through when they see your page in search</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is the kind of work I do with clients every day — and it’s also why I created HelixScribe. It’s not just about writing faster. It’s about writing smarter, publishing more consistently, and building a content system that actually moves your business forward.</p>

    <h2>SEO is structure for your marketing &amp; beyond</h2>
    <p>If your website isn’t ranking, it’s not because you’ve failed — it’s because no one helped you put the pieces together properly.</p>
    <p>You don’t need more content. You need content that connects, supports your site, and gets found for the right things.</p>
