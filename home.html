    <h1>Website and app development powered by AI to scale content &amp; reach</h1>
    <p>Whether it's websites, content, or AI tools, we bring clarity to complex ideas and turn them into results.</p>

    <h2>Let’s start building your digital system</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>Automation &amp; AI integration</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>CREATING SPACE TO THINK BIGGER</h2>
    <h2>Every build, supported by AI</h2>
    <p>The same AI systems behind these features now power HelixScribe: a platform we built, shaped by hands‑on experience and real marketing needs.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Repurposed content without rewriting</strong></li>

        <li><strong>Better output with faster scalability</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>HelixScribe.AI</h2>
    <p>HelixScribe.AI helps you create consistent content in your own voice — from blogs and social posts to email campaigns. It's not a chatbot. It's a system that learns your brand tone, avoids rewrite loops, and improves with each edit.</p>

        <li>Turns notes, URLs, and PDFs into publish‑ready content</li>

    <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
    <h3>How long does typical web application development take?</h3>
    <p>Most medium sized projects take 4–8 weeks depending on complexity. Timelines include structured planning and fast build cycles.</p>
    <h3>Do you build mobile apps too?</h3>
    <p>Yes — including Android, iOS, and progressive web apps. We help publish and test across platforms.</p>
    <h3>What support is available?</h3>
    <p>After launch, support includes content edits, bug fixes, updates, and improvements. You're never left on your own.</p>
    <h3>Can I edit content myself?</h3>
    <p>Yes — we build intuitive back ends so you stay in control. You can make changes or hand them off if preferred.</p>
    <h3>What’s the difference between a website and a web app?</h3>
    <p>A website shows content. A web application does something — dashboards, portals, automation. We build both.</p>
