    <p>Whether you're publishing research, growing a client base, or explaining a complex product, your site should help people find what they need — and stick around.</p>

    <h2>What we build</h2>
    <p>Fast, structured &amp; flexible websites for business growth</p>
    <p>From structured WordPress builds to custom‑coded platforms, we work with business owners like you to develop websites that reflect your brand identity, support your content, simplify your workflow, and scale with your business.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Structured websites: For teams that need a reliable, scalable platform for content, lead generation, or product marketing.</li>
        <li>Redesigns &amp; rebuilds: For businesses that need to update their site, but don't have the time or budget to do it themselves.</li>
        <li>Content‑led platforms: For organisations that publish research, data, or expert analysis and need a site that supports it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Website features</h2>
    <p>Use your website as a built‑in marketing tool</p>
    <p>See how we build websites that go beyond simply placing your service offering on a page. From attracting leads to building community, we include the features that support your business goals — and turn your website into a powerful platform.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Contact forms: Make it easy for potential new clients to reach out — no clutter, just clear conversions.</li>
        <li>Lead magnets: Capture interest with downloads, free guides, or signup offers — all built in.</li>
        <li>Email newsletter sign‑ups: Build your audience with seamless email opt‑ins that connect to your tools.</li>
        <li>E‑commerce: Sell products or services on your website. We can add a simple checkout and/or full product pages.</li>
        <li>Community spaces: Members‑only areas, logins, profiles, or forums — all integrated with your content, brand, and wider presence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Let’s make your website easier to use</h2>
    <p>If you're a business owner stuck with a site that's hard to update, slow to load, or disconnected from how your business works — we'll help you change that.</p>
    <p>We bring the coding knowledge and strategic insight, so you’re not limited by generic website templates — just ready for the first step toward a site that supports your business.</p>
